# pdf overlay
Simple PDF Overlay / AJAX

A simple demo app to overlay PDF files based on predefined PDF models. 

The models should only contain one page. The resulting file will have all the pages overlayed with the page from the selected model.
If more than one file is selected the result will be a ZIP file with all the processed files.

Tested on 'Apache Tomcat 8.0.23 x86' and using 'pdfbox-1.8.11'. Browsers tested: "Google Chrome 51" and "Internet Explorer 11".
All the files/libs are already included. So, this app should work "out of the box".
